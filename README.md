### Neural Style Transfer
- [x] [Neural Style Transfer: A Review](https://github.com/fancoo/Papers-Reading/blob/master/Neural-Style-Transfer/Neural%20Style%20Transfer-A%20Review.pdf) :star::star::star::star:
	* Investigate the works of Neural Style Transfer till May of 2016.
- [] [Demystifying Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01036)
	* Prove that matching the Gram matrices is actually equivalent to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy(MMD) with second order polynomial kernel.
	* Try out for different kernel and parameters.
- [] [Fast Patch-based Style Transfer of Arbitrary Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04337)
	* A more advanced version of "Fast" Neural Style Transfer that can run in real-time and applies to infinite kind of styles.
	* The drawback is the quality of stylized images is worse than "Fast" Neural Style which yet can only applies to finite styles.
